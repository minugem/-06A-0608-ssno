                    <p class="text">With computers being further implemented in education and learning, there has been
                        an
                        increasing rise in the usage of the flipped classroom model in higher education. The flipped
                        classroom
                        model is a “student-centred learning method” (Ozdamli & Asiksoy, 2016, p. 99) that is commonly
                        structured by students watching lecture recordings at home and completing typical homework in
                        class.
                        This results in direct instruction not being conducted in large groups, rather, they are
                        delivered
                        individually, often through teacher-created videos (Bergmann & Sams, 2014). Students are
                        expected to
                        prepare by studying before class, giving students the opportunity to use this knowledge inside
                        of the
                        classroom with the guidance of a teacher during the course (Ozdamli & Asiksoy, 2016), resulting
                        in
                        interactive, collaborative and problem-solving activities to be carried out inside of the
                        classroom
                        (Cabı, 2018). As Bergmann & Sams (2014) said, “Flipped learning, at its core, is individualized
                        learning” (p. 7). As a result of this, the utilisation of this method of learning greatly
                        affects how a
                        student will learn, with several studies researching the benefits and drawback of the flipped
                        learning
                        model on a students education. </p>

                    <p class="text">Ahmed (2016) points out how, despite teachers being aware that students do not
                        understand
                        the material they are teaching, there is not enough time in a traditional classroom model for
                        teachers
                        to assist each student individually in the class period without falling behind schedule. This
                        teaching
                        style is teacher-centred, with no differentiation between the way students are taught. As a
                        result,
                        students are passive learners, with teachers taking control of all responsibility for the
                        students'
                        learning (Bergmann & Sams, 2014). The flipped classroom learning model directly combats this by
                        utilising technology to grant the teacher more time to interact with students instead of
                        lecturing. This
                        allows for teachers to prioritise creating opportunities for students (Yungwei, 2016) with
                        “student-centred strategies, approaches, and curricula to provide students with dynamic and
                        innovative
                        opportunities for their learning.“ (Brewer, 2018, p. 409). This model of learning has several
                        benefits
                        for the student, such as “more one on one time with students, opportunities for active and
                        collaborative
                        learning, missed lectures, self-paced learning, and ‘‘just-in-time’’ type instruction” (Roach,
                        2014, p.
                        75). Below is a diagram from Ahemd (2016) detailing the differences between the traditional and
                        flipped
                        classroom methods. </p>
