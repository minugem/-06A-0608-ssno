            <p class="text">With computers being further implemented in education and learning, there has been
                an
                increasing rise in the usage of the flipped classroom model in higher education. The flipped
                classroom
                model is a “student-centred learning method” (Ozdamli & Asiksoy, 2016, p. 99) that is commonly
                structured by students watching lecture recordings at home and completing typical homework in
                class.
                This results in direct instruction not being conducted in large groups, rather, they are
                delivered
                individually, often through teacher-created videos (Bergmann & Sams, 2014). Students are
                expected to
                prepare by studying before class, giving students the opportunity to use this knowledge inside
                of the
                classroom with the guidance of a teacher during the course (Ozdamli & Asiksoy, 2016), resulting
                in
                interactive, collaborative and problem-solving activities to be carried out inside of the
                classroom
                (Cabı, 2018). As Bergmann & Sams (2014) said, “Flipped learning, at its core, is individualized
                learning” (p. 7). As a result of this, the utilisation of this method of learning greatly
                affects how a
                student will learn, with several studies researching the benefits and drawback of the flipped
                learning
                model on a students education. </p>

            <p class="text">Ahmed (2016) points out how, despite teachers being aware that students do not
                understand
                the material they are teaching, there is not enough time in a traditional classroom model for
                teachers
                to assist each student individually in the class period without falling behind schedule. This
                teaching
                style is teacher-centred, with no differentiation between the way students are taught. As a
                result,
                students are passive learners, with teachers taking control of all responsibility for the
                students'
                learning (Bergmann & Sams, 2014). The flipped classroom learning model directly combats this by
                utilising technology to grant the teacher more time to interact with students instead of
                lecturing. This
                allows for teachers to prioritise creating opportunities for students (Yungwei, 2016) with
                “student-centred strategies, approaches, and curricula to provide students with dynamic and
                innovative
                opportunities for their learning.“ (Brewer, 2018, p. 409). This model of learning has several
                benefits
                for the student, such as “more one on one time with students, opportunities for active and
                collaborative
                learning, missed lectures, self-paced learning, and ‘‘just-in-time’’ type instruction” (Roach,
                2014, p.
                75). Below is a diagram from Ahemd (2016) detailing the differences between the traditional and
                flipped
                classroom methods. </p>
            <p class="text">The flipped classroom model presents students with a plethora of opportunities. Students are
                able
                to gain exposure to pre-class materials through video recordings. This blended learning
                environment allows for students to gain more control over how their time is spent, allowing for
                the student to take responsibility in regards to their education. This has an added benefit for
                these students by allowing students who are falling behind to rewatch past video recordings
                (Ahmed, 2016). A survey regarding student engagement performed by Fisher et al. (2017) showed
                that students strongly felt that they were in control of their learning, crediting the flipped
                learning model to this. This model of learning ultimately makes students become more
                independent. Students had found that the control they had over their learning and time led to a
                positive learning experience. Furthermore, survey participants noted that the ability to control
                their time granted several positive benefits by allowing a greater flexibility in regards to
                their timetable. Additionally, Cabı (2018) reported that students autonomously studying and
                subsequently reaching their academic goals raised students’ self-confidence. Students ultimately
                gain control of their education, under this learning model they are granted a choice in what
                content they engage in and when (Brewer, 2018). The control students had over their learning
                served as training for self-directed learning, allowing for students to further develop their
                self-discipline skills (Yungwei, 2016).
            </p>
            <p class="text">Teachers are able to utilise the preparation students perform before the class to then
                assist and
                build off of the knowledge the student possesses. Students are able to get individualised
                support as a result of this, getting assistance for the level of knowledge they have (Brewer,
                2018). The pre-preparation for class also adds to increased teamwork skills, as students won’t
                spend the entire class time focusing on learning new material and can instead work with their
                peers more effectively and enhance both of their understandings on the given topic (Du et al.,
                2014). Yungwei (2016) brings attention to how the lack of formal lectures allows for students to
                discuss opinions with one another, with Ahmed (2016) adding to this my mentioning that the
                flipped classroom model lengthens the amount of time students can interact with their peers as
                well as with their teachers. This promotes inquiry-based learning, as students are able to more
                directly ask questions and get responses.</p>
            <p class="text">The use of electronics in flipped classrooms grants students the opportunities to learn
                anywhere
                and at any time. Fisher et al. (2017) points out that with this advantage, students who are
                under time constraints are able to use their mobile devices to access and engage in course
                material anywhere, allowing for them to increase their time management skills. This allows for
                remote learning to occur if the individual is ill or otherwise unable to arrive to class
                (Birgili et al., 2021). Another advantage with the implementation of technology that Du et al.
                (2014) elaborates on is the use to rewatch videos repeatedly. They point out that students in a
                traditional classroom may struggle to transcribe the information given to them from a teacher,
                however, with the use of video, students are able to freely rewind and fast-forwards when
                necessary. Birgili et al. (2021) makes an interesting point regarding the benefit of utilising
                technology in this learning model, as using videos to teach Generation Z can increase the appeal
                and efficiency of learning. They also mention how visual ads “help students to have an integral
                outlook as well as increase their commitment to the class and enhance their ability to transfer
                acquired knowledge to other topics” (p. 386).</p>
            <p class="text">Flipped classrooms' biggest strength is its personalisation. Students are able to adjust the
                way
                they learn to meet their needs, such as if they have a preference for being in an auditory or
                visual medium and if they perform better in the morning or afternoon. Every student has an
                individual learning style and a flipped classroom is able to more adequately cater to that
                (Ahmed, 2016). This model of learning encourages students to develop their critical thinking,
                collaboration, communications (Brewer, 2018) and problem-solving skills (Birgili et al., 2021),
                as well as encouraging “social interaction, teamwork and cultural diversity among students” (Du
                et al., 2014, p. 18) by requiring students to collaborate with one another. Flipped learning
                allows for a personalised education to fit each individual student's needs, granting each
                student the opportunity to learn at a pace that suits them and ultimately results in students
                “engaging with content, engaging with their classmates, and taking control over their own
                learning” (Ahmed, 2016, p.432).

            <p class="text">The flipped classroom model isn’t without its risks towards students. Cabı (2018) states
                that the problems regarding this learning model can be “categorized under three main titles: Motivation,
                Content, and Learning” (p. 216), providing a table showing their results when they asked students what
                problems they encountered.</p>
