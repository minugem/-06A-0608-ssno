            <p class="text">Our chosen topic is : The Flipped Learning Experience on students.With computers being
                further implemented in education and learning, there has been an
                increasing rise in the usage of the flipped classroom model in higher education. The flipped classroom
                model is a “student-centred learning method” (Ozdamli & Asiksoy, 2016, p. 99) that is commonly
                structured by students watching lecture recordings at home and completing typical homework in class.
                This results in direct instruction not being conducted in large groups, rather, they are delivered
                individually, often through teacher-created videos (Bergmann & Sams, 2014). Students are expected to
                prepare by studying before class, giving students the opportunity to use this knowledge inside of the
                classroom with the guidance of a teacher during the course (Ozdamli & Asiksoy, 2016), resulting in
                interactive, collaborative and problem-solving activities to be carried out inside of the classroom
                (Cabı, 2018). As Bergmann & Sams (2014) said, “Flipped learning, at its core, is individualized
                learning” (p. 7). As a result of this, the utilisation of this method of learning greatly affects how a
                student will learn, with several studies researching the benefits and drawbacks of the flipped learning
                model on a students education. </p>

                <h2 class="text">Opportunities</h2>
                <p class="text">Ahmed (2016) points out how, despite teachers being aware that students do not
                    understand
                    the material they are teaching, there is not enough time in a traditional classroom model for
                    teachers
                    to assist each student individually in the class period without falling behind schedule. This
                    teaching
                    style is teacher-centred, with no differentiation between the way students are taught. As a result,
                    students are passive learners, with teachers taking control of all responsibility for the students'
                    learning (Bergmann & Sams, 2014). The flipped classroom learning model directly combats this by
                    utilising technology to grant the teacher more time to interact with students instead of lecturing.
                    This
                    allows for teachers to prioritise creating opportunities for students (Yungwei, 2016) with
                    “student-centred strategies, approaches, and curricula to provide students with dynamic and
                    innovative
                    opportunities for their learning.“ (Brewer, 2018, p. 409). This model of learning has several
                    benefits
                    for the student, such as “more one on one time with students, opportunities for active and
                    collaborative
                    learning, missed lectures, self-paced learning, and ‘‘just-in-time’’ type instruction” (Roach, 2014,
                    p.
                    75). Below is a diagram from Ahemd (2016) detailing the differences between the traditional and
                    flipped
                    classroom methods.
                </p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img class="image" src="images/triangle.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <p class="text">The utilisation of the flipped learning model presents students with a plethora of
                    opportunities throughout their education. Students are able to gain exposure to pre-class materials
                    through video recordings. This blended learning environment allows for students to gain more control
                    over how their time is spent, allowing for the student to take responsibility in regards to their
                    education. This has an added benefit for these students by allowing students who are falling behind
                    to
                    rewatch past video recordings (Ahmed, 2016). A survey regarding student engagement performed by
                    Fisher
                    et al. (2017) showed that students strongly felt that they were in control of their learning,
                    crediting
                    the flipped learning model to this. This model of learning ultimately results in students becoming
                    more
                    independent. Students had found that the control they had over their learning and time led to an
                    overall
                    positive learning experience. Furthermore, survey participants noted that the ability to control
                    their
                    time granted several positive benefits by allowing a greater flexibility in regards to their
                    timetable,
                    allowing for the student to better balance their personal and educational lives. Additionally, Cabı
                    (2018) reported that students autonomously studying and subsequently reaching their academic goals
                    raised students’ self-confidence. Students ultimately gain control of their education, under this
                    learning model they are granted a choice in what content they engage in and when (Brewer, 2018). The
                    control students had over their learning served as training for self-directed learning, allowing for
                    students to further develop their self-discipline skills (Yungwei, 2016).

                </p>
                <p class="text">Teachers are able to utilise the preparation students perform before the class to then
                    assist and build off of the knowledge the student possesses. Students are able to get individualised
                    support as a result of this, getting assistance for the level of knowledge they have (Brewer, 2018).
                    The
                    pre-preparation for class also adds to increased teamwork skills, as students won’t spend the entire
                    class time focusing on learning new material and can instead work with their peers more effectively
                    and
                    enhance both of their understandings on the given topic (Du et al., 2014). Yungwei (2016) brings
                    attention to how the lack of formal lectures allows for students to discuss opinions with one
                    another,
                    with Ahmed (2016) adding to this my mentioning that the flipped classroom model lengthens the amount
                    of
                    time students can interact with their peers as well as with their teachers. This promotes
                    inquiry-based
                    learning, as students are able to more directly ask questions and get responses.</p>
                <p class="text">The use of electronics in flipped classrooms grants students the opportunities to learn
                    anywhere and at any time. Fisher et al. (2017) points out that with this advantage, students who are
                    under time constraints are able to use their mobile devices to access and engage in course material
                    anywhere, allowing for them to increase their time management skills. This allows for remote
                    learning to
                    occur if the individual is ill or otherwise unable to arrive to class (Birgili et al., 2021).
                    Another
                    advantage with the implementation of technology that Du et al. (2014) elaborates on is the use to
                    rewatch videos repeatedly. They point out that students in a traditional classroom may struggle to
                    transcribe the information given to them from a teacher, however, with the use of video, students
                    are
                    able to freely rewind and fast-forwards when necessary. Birgili et al. (2021) makes an interesting
                    point
                    regarding the benefit of utilising technology in this learning model, as using videos to teach
                    Generation Z can increase the appeal and efficiency of learning. They also mention how visual ads
                    “help
                    students to have an integral outlook as well as increase their commitment to the class and enhance
                    their
                    ability to transfer acquired knowledge to other topics” (p. 386).
                </p>
                <p class="text">Flipped classrooms' biggest strength is its personalisation. Students are able to adjust
                    the
                    way they learn to meet their needs, such as if they have a preference for being in an auditory or
                    visual
                    medium and if they perform better in the morning or afternoon. Every student has an individual
                    learning
                    style and a flipped classroom is able to more adequately cater to that (Ahmed, 2016). This model of
                    learning encourages students to develop their critical thinking, collaboration, communications
                    (Brewer,
                    2018) and problem-solving skills (Birgili et al., 2021), as well as encouraging “social interaction,
                    teamwork and cultural diversity among students” (Du et al., 2014, p. 18) by requiring students to
                    collaborate with one another. Flipped learning allows for a personalised education to fit each
                    individual student's needs, granting each student the opportunity to learn at a pace that suits them
                    and
                    ultimately results in students “engaging with content, engaging with their classmates, and taking
                    control over their own learning” (Ahmed, 2016, p.432).

                <h2 class="text">Risks</h2>
                <p class="text">The flipped classroom model isn’t without its risks towards students, as depending on
                    the
                    individual, many of the opportunities this learning model presents can also be drawbacks. Cabı
                    (2018)
                    states that the problems regarding this learning model can be “categorized under three main titles:
                    Motivation, Content, and Learning” (p. 216), providing a table showing their results when they asked
                    students what problems they encountered.
                </p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img class="image" src="images/table2.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <p class="text">The flipped learning model has a heavy reliance on student participation in their own
                    time,
                    as a result it becomes the students responsibility to view the material before their class. However,
                    students' learning will be impacted by time constraints limiting the amount of time they may
                    dedicate to
                    studying, directly impacting student preparedness (Cabı, 2018). Additionally, students may be unable
                    to
                    properly balance the amount of time dedicated to each class, as some subjects may be too complicated
                    to
                    complete online due to the content being taught being far too long and intensive (Fisher et al.,
                    2017)
                    and as a result they may spend more time on these courses than they would have in a traditional
                    classroom model (Yungwei, 2016). Less motivated students will also interact less with their
                    pre-class
                    material, inevitably get less work completed, as well as they are likely to procrastinate when it
                    comes
                    to completing pre-course material, all of which will impact their learning inside of the classroom
                    (Du
                    et al., 2014). Both Ozdamli & Asiksoy (2016) and Birgili et al. (2021) point out that if students do
                    not
                    interact with the pre-class material, it results in instructors being unable to proceed with the
                    course
                    material and students being unable to follow material inside of the classroom. Furthermore, Yungwei
                    (2016) brings attention to how students' lack of preparedness doesn’t just affect the individual,
                    but
                    any group they are assigned in for class work, resulting in students who had prepared for the class
                    doing more work than they should have and an overall lack of teamwork in the classroom. Similarly,
                    Fisher et al. (2017) mentions how the lack of constantly being told what to do left students with
                    low
                    self-motivation to not improve their study habits. Zhu et al. (2022) adds to this by pointing out
                    how
                    this low engagement with the course material negatively impacts overall academic performance of the
                    individual. Student’s education and overall achievement is dependent on their participation as “Any
                    tendency of learners to refuse to take part in lesson preparation, may result in a negative effect
                    on
                    their academic performance” (Birgili et al. 2021, p. 370).

                <p class="text">Cabı (2018) brings attention to the difficulty students experience when studying outside
                    of
                    the classroom, as well as the difficulty some students may experience when attempting to understand
                    the
                    course material. Due to the less formal environment, students are discouraged from studying course
                    material. Likewise, Yungwei (2012) includes students hesitancy to learn under the flipped classroom
                    model, stating that the course work was difficult to comprehend and that some cannot understand the
                    content they have read, rather preferring to have an instructor teach them instead. Similarly, Cabı
                    (2018) also found that some students would prefer to learn inside of the classroom with a video
                    recording to watch later if needed due to the inability to concentrate on studying on their own.
                </p>
                <p class="text">As Birgili et al. (2021) points out, video quality can make a huge impact on a students
                    learning experience. If the videos are too long or of a poor quality, students may be negatively
                    impacted. Additionally, Zhu et al. (2022) adds that videos over 50 minutes in length tended not to
                    be
                    attractive to students. Another drawback of the pre-class work being online is that students are
                    required to sit in front of a computer screen, ultimately increasing the amount of screentime a
                    student
                    gets (Du et al., 2014). Another struggle students may experience due to technology is the
                    distraction
                    they cause. Both Du et al. (2014) and Fisher et al. (2017) point out that the presence of
                    technology,
                    including social media, television and computers, distracts students from completing their class
                    work.
                </p>
                <p class="text">It is important to also recognise that this model of learning cannot be applied to
                    everybody
                    and that individual differences need to be considered (Yungwei, 2016). Fisher et al. (2017) found
                    that
                    students commonly found trouble adjusting to the flipped learning model, ultimately creating a
                    significant learning curb in the beginning of the semester due to issues understanding how the
                    learning
                    process was structured. Yungwei (2016) also found that many students were not prepared for the
                    responsibility that comes with taking control of your learning, and students lacking readiness when
                    it
                    comes to self-directed learning had difficulty staying on track with the course materials. One of
                    flipped learning's biggest advantages, the ability for students to personalise their learning
                    experience, can also be one of the largest risks as students may not be prepared for the
                    responsibilities.

                <h2 class="text">Choices</h2>
                <p class="text">With the flipped learning models common implementation around the globe, several
                    questions
                    are raised surrounding the choices provided by using this model of learning. The flipped learning
                    model
                    is described as being a universal-design component by Sullivan (2018), this means it is to be
                    usable,
                    accessible and inclusive for everyone without the need for adaptation or specialised design
                    (Burgstahler, 2021). However, Sullivan (2018) notes that providers of flipped learning need to
                    consider
                    how using this model impacts the barriers to access, as students with chronic illnesses that prevent
                    them from attending class may cause challenges, as attendance to classes is crucial when using this
                    learning model. While flipped learning does ultimately connect more people to education in an easy
                    fashion, individual circumstances still need to be considered as they can still prevent people from
                    utilising this model of learning.

                </p>
                <p class="text">Flipped learning is fundamentally linked to technology, to the point that it cannot
                    happen
                    without it (Birgili et al., 2021). As such, the lack of proper access to equipment that
                    extraordinarily
                    affects a students education. Ozdamli & Asiksoy (2016) mentions how student’s learning can be
                    impacted
                    by the lack of equipment, such as lacking a computer or having difficulty connecting and accessing
                    the
                    internet. Similarly, Du et al. (2014) focuses on how students, specifically those from lower income
                    backgrounds, may not be able to purchase their own computers and may not have access to the
                    internet,
                    which is required to participate in a flipped classroom. The students whose access to the internet
                    fluctuated are put at a disadvantage compared to their peers. They further point out how these
                    students
                    will be forced to use public computers or networks, from places such as a library, which can become
                    a
                    problem if they are unable to access these resources.

                </p>
                <p class="text">Flipped learning primarily utilises online lectures and content to deliver course
                    material
                    to students, which can lead to a lack of personalisation in the content given. As Sullivan (2018)
                    points
                    out, if these lectures are not accessible by adaptive software, students with visual, learning or
                    auditory processing disabilities are disadvantaged compared to their peers. This brings attention to
                    the
                    importance of lectures and course coordinators addressing the individual needs of students and
                    adapting
                    accordingly to them, allowing for everybody to engage in the course content equally. Similarly, Chen
                    &
                    Hsu (2022) recognised that the flipped learning model fell short where in the areas lacking
                    variation to
                    fit the individual needs of the students. Furthermore, Chen & Hsu (2022) conducted a study on
                    flipped
                    learning and if adaptive instructions and teaching techniques could improve a students education.
                    Adaptive teaching helps make up for the shortcomings flipped learning presents by customising to the
                    students needs. At the end of the study, it was found that with the implementation of adaptive
                    teaching
                    the average grade of students increased from 50.27 to 64.69, as shown in the table below.

                <p class="text">As AI grows in popularity, it becomes increasingly relevant when considering flipped
                    learning, specifically when AI is implemented in chatbots. A review by Lo & Hew (2023) had found
                    that AI
                    was being designed and trained as a learning chatbot that provided students with real-time
                    personalised
                    feedback on the students performance and answered questions asked by the students. Additionally, it
                    was
                    found that an assisting chatbot could provide students resources for the student to utilise as
                    pre-class
                    material and that a mentoring chatbot could assist students in creating learning goals and provide
                    advice on how they may achieve these goals. These chatbots granted students with immediate feedback
                    for
                    their studies, increased class preparedness, student confidence, and engagement with the course
                    content.
                    However, the implementation of AI chatbots in flipped learning isn’t without challenges. These
                    chatbots
                    were shown to be limited in their technical functionality, as they may be inadequate in providing to
                    the
                    students' needs, and presented a lack of authenticity when answering students' questions. Chatbots
                    are
                    an extremely recent technology that has seen a surge in its use and advancements. Whilst it has been
                    shown to provide significant benefits to students in helping further their knowledge, there are
                    still
                    several limitations that the AI faces which can ultimately only be resolved by humans.

                <h2 class="text">Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="text">As computers are becoming progressively more entwined with education and learning, it
                    has
                    become increasingly important to understand the impacts of the flipped learning model on students
                    and
                    their education. Flipped learning presents students with a plethora of opportunities throughout
                    their
                    education. This model of learning is student-centred, this leaves students in control of their
                    education, ultimately increasing students self-confidence, responsibility and various other personal
                    skills. As a result, this grants students with a large amount of personalisation when studying,
                    allowing
                    for them to choose when, where and what to study. Furthermore, students are able to access course
                    material through their devices, allowing for them to learn anywhere. However, flipped learning is
                    not
                    without its risks, as plenty of the opportunities flipped learning presents can backfire on the
                    student.
                    As a result of students being in control of their studies, students with little motivation and poor
                    time
                    management skills may ignore the course materials, ultimately having a negative effect on their
                    academic
                    performance. Furthermore, if one student's neglect of their study doesn’t just affect them, it also
                    affects the students around them. In group activities, the other team members will end up having to
                    take
                    on more work than they should have. Subject complexity is another concern, as the self-directed
                    learning
                    may make it difficult for students who lack understanding in the course material to study and
                    further
                    their education. The flipped learning model does provide a plethora of choices for students. The
                    lack of
                    access to the internet and computers can significantly impact a student's education, as well as the
                    personalisation of education material to cater to individuals needs. Additionally, the rise in AI
                    has
                    become increasingly relevant in the discussions around flipped learning, as chatbots made with AI
                    can
                    greatly impact a students studies. Ultimately, the success of the flipped learning model depends on
                    the
                    individual. Whilst it is pertinent to take the individual into consideration as the success of this
                    model highly depends on the individual, flipped learning allows for students to have a greater
                    control
                    and far more personalisation than they would have under a traditional learning model.
