            <p class="text">With computers being further implemented in education and learning, there has been an
                increasing rise in the usage of the flipped classroom model in higher education. The flipped classroom
                model is a “student-centred learning method” (Ozdamli & Asiksoy, 2016, p. 99) that is commonly
                structured by students watching lecture recordings at home and completing typical homework in class.
                This results in direct instruction not being conducted in large groups, rather, they are delivered
                individually, often through teacher-created videos (Bergmann & Sams, 2014). Students are expected to
                prepare by studying before class, giving students the opportunity to use this knowledge inside of the
                classroom with the guidance of a teacher during the course (Ozdamli & Asiksoy, 2016), resulting in
                interactive, collaborative and problem-solving activities to be carried out inside of the classroom
                (Cabı, 2018). As Bergmann & Sams (2014) said, “Flipped learning, at its core, is individualized
                learning” (p. 7). As a result of this, the utilisation of this method of learning greatly affects how a
                student will learn, with several studies researching the benefits and drawback of the flipped learning
                model on a students education. </p>
